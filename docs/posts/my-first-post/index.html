It’s as if the internet was given a tongue and a mouth.\nIt has seen use in many facets of life today.

Is it out of arrogance? Out of egotism? Well, I do not know. Maybe it stems from the many times I’ve tried to use it in my day-to-day, to produce accurate examples and code, and seen it fail.

Well, if the action proves to be unreasonable, then we have someone to keep accountable. This makes sense, but automation isn’t anything new in the modern world. We have automated systems taking actions every day. It’s how our devices communicate, and how I’m able to write my thoughts into bits by hitting small keys on my laptop.

It is usually determined precisely, at runtime, how the program will behave, given its current inputs. LLM’s are not like that, and that’s what makes them magical.

Why? Because we can’t blame it for what it did. It is simply a program that carries out instructions, but it is also random. It is also hard to examine and troubleshoot mistakes and get to root causes. At one point, we say: well, it IS in fact random. We can tilt the weights in the direction we want it to behave in, but that’s as far as that goes. If we tilt too hard, it becomes boring and redundant. It becomes a deterministic software program, or a bunch of if statements. If we don’t, we can’t rely on it, as it is random. There is truly a beautiful paradox here, and potentially a limitation of information theory itself.\nCan we build a system that is both reliably useful and inherently unpredictable? Or does that break some fundamental boundary?\n",
